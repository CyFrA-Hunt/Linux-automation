BASH : Bourne again shell(stephen Bourne in 1979)


BASH VS SCRIPT :


BASH : bash is a program that inteprets the you tye in terminal and passes them on to the OS. 
SCRIPT : script is a file and it's containing the commands for the shell


Bash Script core componets :

	1.) Begining of the script (shabangu line(#!/bin/bash))
	2.) Middle of the script(commands) 
	3.) End of the script(Exitcode) 

		Shabangu line :
	
			* shabangu line is the very first line of the script (#!)*
			* it's indicate the what programing language using this script
			* shabangu line basically tells the shell what interpreter should be used to read the script
	
		Commands :
	
		  	* body of the script
	
		Exit code :
		
		  	* exitcode range (0-255)
		  	* if exitcode is 0 the script was executed succesfully
		  	* 1 or any other value it's return the error
    
    example :
    
    #!/bin/bash                    
    			                    # A blank line for the formatting reasons	
    echo "Hello world!:)"            # just print the text
    exit 0                          # put the exit code

Inline-commants:

	NOTE ::: Don't add a commant in shabangu line
	
	* inline commants are starts with # symbol

	Basic components of script :

    	* Author name (name of the script author)
    	* Date Created (date of the script created)
    	* Last Modified (date of the last modified the script)
    	* Description (script description in shortly)
    	* Usage (usage of the script)

    example :

    #!/bin/bash

    # Author : CyFrA_vijay
    # Date Crated : 13/09/2021
    # Date Modified : 13/09/2021

    # Description 
    # Print the hello world in your terminal

    # usage
    # Just rn the script

    echo "Hello world :)"
    exit 0

Exercise :

Task : to create a home directory backupfile

Script :

#!/bin/bash

# Author : CyFrA_Viijay
# Date Created : 13/09/2021
# Date Modified : 13/09/2021

# Description:
# Home directory backupfile

#usage:
#just run the code 

tar -cvf ~/Bash/testing/backup_"$(date +%d-%m-%y_%H-%M-%S)".tar ~/* 2>/dev/null #c-create a new archive ; v-verbose ;f - archive path ; ~/* - select the all home directory files
exit 0


Add your scripts is system path varibale :
	
	step 1 : move to the home directory
	step 2 : open .profile file 
	step 3 : then add --> export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/<script directory name>"
	step 4 : next reload your .profile --> source .profile
	step 5 : just check the path --> echo "$PATH"
